## Hypotheses and Dataset Description
We have chosen a data set containing information on the pizza sales of Plato's Pizzas, a small pizzeria with a seating capacity of 15 tables and 60 seats total. The dataset contains all transactional data collected over the past year 2015. The questions we would like to analyze in this project are as follows:

1. What days and times do we tend to be busiest?
2. How many pizzas are we making during peak periods?
3. How well are we utilizing our seating capacity? 
4. Are pizza sales higher on the weekends compared to the weekdays?

Preliminary Hypothesis: Plato's will be busiest on the weekends.
